# Dave - Administrators

This section of the documentation is for [Dave: the operator](/users#dave-the-operator). Here you will find instructions on how to perform a Nuvla installation, as well as Docker Swarm infrastructures (running in public or private clouds) on which to deploy containers and optionally to run Nuvla itself.

The following diagram shows the main blocks of the Nuvla Architecture.
