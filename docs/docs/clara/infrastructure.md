# Infrastructures

Before you can deploy containers, you'll need a running Nuvla service and a Docker Swarm installation to deploy to. For Nuvla, you can use SixSq's managed service available on [nuvla.io](https://test.nuvla.io) or [deploy your own Nuvla](/docs/dave/nuvla-deployment-quick). For the Docker Swarm infrastructure, either ask a colleague, [SixSq](mailto:info@sixsq.com) or [deploy your own Docker Swarm](/docs/dave/swarm-deployment) cluster.

Using [Nuvla](https://test.nuvla.io) is free for evaluation, and you will soon be able to deploy Docker Swarm clusters from the web UI. So it's the easiest way to get started.
